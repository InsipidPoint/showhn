/**
 * Benchmark calibration set — 15 real Show HN posts (3 per tier) with
 * verified tier assignments and explanations. Injected into every analysis
 * call to anchor the model's judgment against known-good examples.
 *
 * History:
 * - Mar 2026: initial 15 calibrators (3 per tier).
 * - Apr 2026: expanded to 30 (6 per tier) to test prompt iteration. Eval showed
 *   the additional calibrators gave ~13pp accuracy lift (53→67%) but doubled
 *   system-prompt cost. Pruned back to 15 keeping the highest-signal ones from
 *   both sets — see selection notes in the entity (memory/entities/hnshowcase.md
 *   under "Calibration set design").
 *
 * Selection criteria for the active 15:
 * - 3 per tier, balancing URL types (~47% GitHub vs production's 41%)
 * - Multiple flavors per tier where justified (gem: constraint craft + collaboration)
 * - AI/agent calibrators present at every relevant tier
 * - Distinct failure modes at the floor (narrative-as-substitute, commodity clone, spec-as-product)
 * - Drop any calibrator that BOTH baseline AND a tested candidate model consistently
 *   miscall — those are bad calibrators, not bad models. Dropped: Habit tracker
 *   (always called mid), Wispr Flow alt (always called solid).
